# ORACLE SmartCity : "Proxima" (2025)

A renewable City model of a city of the future with intelligent integration into the Cloud, which was developed as part of the student internship in 2025 by Luise J., Smilla F. and Enno W. at Oracle (DE). In 4 Days we developed the following code for an Arduino (MKR-1000 WiFi) and a Raspberry Pi 3 (Model_B Plus Rev 1.3). 

Structure: 
1) WeatherStation - Arduino (_so called: "temperature.ino"_)  / Sensor Array (Humidity + Temperature)
2) PowerPlant Regulator - Arduino (_so called: "Windanlage_Master.ino"_)  / Relay to switch on/off the Wind Turbine  
3) SmartTrain - Rasberry Pi 3 (_so called: "Bluetooth_Connection_LEGO_Hub"_)  / Drivers for Lego (Train) Hub


1. Weather Station - TX-Arduino (Arduino (Type): MKR-1000 WiFi)
   Expl. : Transmission-Arduino [--> TX] wired up to a combination sensor [Humidity (+) Temperature] (DHT 11) that reads the data and displays it in form of Text in
