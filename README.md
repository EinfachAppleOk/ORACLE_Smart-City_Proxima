# ORACLE SmartCity : "Proxima" (2025)

A renewable City model of a city of the future with intelligent integration into the Cloud, which was developed as part of the student internship in 2025 by Luise J., Smilla F. and Enno W. at Oracle (DE). In 4 Days we developed the following code for an Arduino (MKR-1000 WiFi) and a Raspberry Pi 3 (Model_B Plus Rev 1.3). 

Structure: 
1) PowerPlant Regulator - Arduino (_so called: "Windanlage_Master.ino"_)
2) WeatherStation - Arduino (_so called: "temperature.ino"_)
3) SmartTrain - Rasberry Pi 3
